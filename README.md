TeamProjectUAlbanyPortal
========================

We are Team #7 from the Software Engineering class of Spring 2013 at SUNY Albany, working on creating the Ualbany Portal.
The UAlbany Portal is a place that acts as the host for a number of services that can be provided to end-users.
We are planning on incorporating a few model services to show its value. We see this project as adding value 
to small businesses who would like to provide their services over the internet.

This portal can be customized and licensed to these businesses who in turn can use it to provide their own service to 
their customers. We have also followed a customizable architecture. Thus, potentially it can be used to provide a wide 
variety of services by many businesses while the heavy lifting will be taken care of by us.
